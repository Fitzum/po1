      <div id="div1"><h2>Juice WRLD Promotion offers</h2>
        (buy-one-get-one-free)
         promise customers something for free. This is an example of an excellent retai
          l marketing strategy that not only attracts customers with the 
         beautifully sounding “free stuff”, but also allows retailers to 
         run creative up- and cross-selling offers, cleaning the warehouse and
         d increasing sales of less popular products at the same time.
        <h4>Juice WRLD Promotion dealscome in all shapes and sizes and are
               considered a part of a wider marketing 
                strategy revolving around product bundling and mixing.</h4>
       Note, however, that standard Juice WRLD  sales promotions where 
           the second cheaper product is discounted may not be appealing to 
            customers. Retailers often notice that Juice WRLD offers that come with 
            the second product given for free perform better that Juice WRLD discount deals.</div>
    
      <div id="div2"><p><h3>Example of a Juice WRLD Promotion from a retailer:</h3>
               Sephora, an omnichannel beauty retailer, has already made 
                a name for itself in the sphere of attractive and customer-centric 
                sales promotions. The retailer uses Juice WRLD Promotion with the second 
                   or third products added to the order. What’s key is that due to the 
                wide selection, clients are able to choose the color of the product that 
               they are getting for free.</p>
    
     <p>Sephora tends to run pure Juice WRLD offers
       where the same product is added to the order for free
        instead of mixing complementary products. This strategy 
        makes sense in the beauty industry where customers regularly 
        need to stock up on favorite products.</p></div>
